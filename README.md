# Dataset Description

This *dataset* is from the National Health and Nutrition Examniation Survey 2017. It records trace metal in urine speicemens. Another part of this data is depression level. A nine-item depression screening instrument were used to assess the participants' depression level. The rest of the dataset is some demographics about the participants, including their age, race, citizenship,etc.

# Project Overview

**This study** enables swift and precise measurements of various elements significant for toxicology and nutrition. Its sensitivity and speed are sufficient for analyzing urine samples from individuals who might have been exposed to key toxic elements. Additionally, it can assess environmental or non-work-related exposure to these elements.The project mainly aims to looks at the correlation between level of trace metal in urine sample and depression measures. 

# Abstract

This study explores the link between Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and essential trace elements, analyzing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). MDD, affecting an estimated 280 million people worldwide, manifests through diverse symptoms impacting emotional, physical, and cognitive well-being. The focus is on trace elements necessary for metabolic functions, as alterations in these elements are implicated in MDD's development. Utilizing NHANES data, the study examines urine samples from participants aged 3 and above for trace metal analysis, employing mass spectrometry for precise quantification. Depressive symptoms are assessed via the PHQ-9 questionnaire, a recognized depression screening tool. By investigating the relationship between trace metals and MDD symptoms, this research aims to enhance our understanding of MDD's etiology and inform potential treatment approaches.
